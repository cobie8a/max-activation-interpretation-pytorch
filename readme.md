# maximal activation
- maximal activation is a simple technique which optimizes the input of a model to maximize an output response
- the code here (in `max_act.py`) shows a simple pytorch implementation of this technique
- this code includes simple regularization for this method
- one example maximizing the class "peacock" for AlexNet:
